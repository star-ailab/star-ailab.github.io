# Research Projects

Our current projects focus on two major thrusts: (1) Security and Privacy of AI and (2) AI for Security (AI-enabled cybersecurity analytics). Our overarching goal is to make cyberspace a safer place.
Here we provide a summary of each thrust along with some examples of our work:

### Security and Privacy of AI

We are working on making AI models more robust against adversarial attacks with a focus on static malware detectors. 


**ARMOR: Adversarially Robust Learning with Optimal Transport Regularized Divergences**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/armor.png){: style="width: 40%; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}

We introduce the ARMOR methods as novel approaches to enhancing the adversarial robustness of deep learning models. These methods are based on a new class of optimal-transport-regularized divergences, constructed via an infimal convolution between an information divergence and an optimal-transport (OT) cost. We use these as tools to enhance  adversarial robustness  by maximizing the expected loss over a neighborhood of distributions, a technique known as distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Viewed as a tool for constructing adversarial samples,  our method allows samples to be both transported, according to the OT cost, and re-weighted, according to the information divergence; the addition of a principled and dynamical adversarial re-weighting on top of adversarial sample transport is the key innovation of $ARMOR_D$. $ARMOR_D$ can be viewed as a generalization of the best-performing loss functions and OT costs in the adversarial training literature; we demonstrate this flexibility by using $ARMOR_D$ to augment the UDR, TRADES, and MART methods and obtain  improved performance on CIFAR-10 image recognition. On CIFAR-10, $ARMOR_D$ leads to 1.5\% and 2.1\% increase in adversarial robustness against two strong adversarial attacks, AutoAttack and $PGD^{200}$, respectively. To foster reproducibility, we made the code accessible at \url{https://github.com/star-ailab/ARMOR}.

**Adversarially Robust Malware Detection with Reinforcement Learning**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/rl.png){: style="width: 40%; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}

Recent machine learning- and deep learning-based static malware detectors have shown breakthrough performance in identifying unseen malware variants. As a result, they are increasingly being adopted to lower the cost of dynamic malware analysis and manual signature identification. Despite their success, studies have shown that they can be vulnerable to adversarial malware attacks, in which an adversary modifies a known malware executable subtly to fool the malware detector into recognizing it as a benign file. Recent studies have shown that automatically crafting these adversarial malware variants at scale is beneficial to improve the robustness of malware detectors. Most extant methods rely on prior knowledge about the architecture or parameters of the detector, which is not often available in practice. Moreover, the majority of these methods are restricted to additive modifications that append contents to the malware executable without modifying its original content. In this study, we offer a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) method, which extends Variational Actor-Critic to non-continuous action spaces where modifications are inherently discrete. 

**Adversarially Robust Malware Detection with Multivew Representation Learning**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/armd.png){: style="width: 20%; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}

Deep learning-based adversarial malware detectors have yielded promising results in detecting never-before-seen malware executables without relying on expensive dynamic behavior
analysis and sandbox. Despite their abilities, these detectors have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial malware variants - meticulously modified, functionality-preserving
versions of original malware executables generated by machine learning. Due to the nature of these adversarial modifications, these adversarial methods often use a single view of
malware executables (i.e., the binary/hexadecimal view) to generate adversarial malware variants.
This provides an opportunity for the defenders (i.e., malware detectors) to detect the adversarial variants by utilizing more than one view of a malware file
(e.g., source code view in addition to the binary view). The rationale behind this idea is that while the adversary focuses on the binary view, certain characteristics 
of the malware file in the source code view remain untouched which leads to the detection of the adversarial malware variants. To capitalize on this opportunity, 
we propose Adversarially Robust Multiview Malware Defense (ARMD), a novel multi-view learning framework to improve the robustness of DL-based malware detectors against 
adversarial variants. Our experiments on three renowned open-source deep learning-based malware detectors across six common malware categories show that ARMD is able to improve 
the adversarial robustness by up to seven times on these malware detectors.

We are working on making AI model training and LLM fine-tuning robust against data reconstruction attacks using differential privacy.

**Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent with Fixed-Size Minibatches**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/fsrdp.png){: style="width: 30%; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}

Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) has been instrumental in privately training deep learning models by providing a framework to control and track the privacy loss incurred during training. At the core of this computation lies a subsampling method that uses a privacy amplification lemma to enhance the privacy guarantees provided by the additive noise. Fixed size subsampling is appealing for its constant memory usage, unlike the variable sized minibatches in Poisson subsampling. It is also of interest in addressing class imbalance and federated learning. However, the current computable guarantees for fixed-size subsampling are not tight and do not consider both add/remove and replace-one adjacency relationships. We present a new and holistic R{é}nyi differential privacy (RDP) accountant for DP-SGD with fixed-size subsampling without replacement (FSwoR) and with replacement (FSwR). For FSwoR we consider both add/remove and replace-one adjacency. Our FSwoR results improves on the best current computable bound by a factor of 4. We also show for the first time that the widely-used Poisson subsampling and FSwoR with replace-one adjacency have the same privacy to leading order in the sampling probability. Accordingly, our work suggests that FSwoR is often preferable to Poisson subsampling due to constant memory usage. Our FSwR accountant includes explicit non-asymptotic upper and lower bounds and, to the authors' knowledge, is the first such analysis of fixed-size RDP with replacement for DP-SGD. We analytically and empirically compare fixed size and Poisson subsampling, and show that DP-SGD gradients in a fixed-size subsampling regime exhibit lower variance in practice in addition to memory usage benefits. 

**Private Fine-Tuninig of Large Language Models**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/ew.png){: style="width: 30%; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}

Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are an integral part of modern AI that have led to breakthrough performances in complex AI tasks. Major AI companies with expensive 
infrastructures are able to develop and train these large models with billions and millions of parameters from scratch. Third parties, researchers, and practitioners are 
increasingly adopting these pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on their private data to accomplish their downstream AI tasks. However, it has been shown that an adversary 
can extract/reconstruct the exact training samples from these LLMs, which can lead to revealing personally identifiable information. The issue has raised deep concerns about 
the privacy of LLMs. Differential privacy (DP) provides a rigorous framework that allows adding noise in the process of training or fine-tuning LLMs such that extracting 
the training data becomes infeasible (i.e., with a cryptographically small success probability). While the theoretical privacy guarantees offered in most extant studies assume 
learning models from scratch through many training iterations in an asymptotic setting, this assumption does not hold in fine-tuning scenarios in which the number of 
training iterations is significantly smaller. To address the gap, we present EW-Tune, a DP framework for fine-tuning LLMs based on Edgeworth accountant with finite-sample privacy guarantees. 
Our results across four well-established natural language understanding (NLU) tasks show that while EW-Tune adds privacy guarantees to LLM fine-tuning process, 
it directly contributes to decreasing the induced noise to up to 5.6% and improves the state-of-the-art LLMs performance by up to 1.1% across all NLU tasks. 
We have open-sourced our implementations for wide adoption and public testing purposes. 


### AI-enabled Cybersecurity

**RADAR: A Framework for Developing Adversarially Robust Cyber Defense AI Agents with Deep Reinforcement Learning** ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/radar.png){: style="width: 3%; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}

The robustness of cyber defense AI agents has raised deep concerns in modern cyber defense. Drawing on the computational design science paradigm, we couple robust optimization and reinforcement learning theories to develop a novel framework, called Reinforcement Learning-based Adversarial Attack Robustness (RADAR), to increase the robustness of cyber defense AI agents against adversarial attacks. To demonstrate practical utility, we instantiate RADAR for malware attacks – the primary cause of financial loss in cyber attacks. Incorporating RADAR in three renowned malware detectors shows an adversarial robustness increase of up to seven times, on average.

**Multilingual Cyber Threat Detection in the Russian Dark Web with Adversarial Deep Representation Learning** ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/rus_en.png){: style="width: 45%; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}

International dark web platforms operating within multiple geopolitical regions and languages host a myriad of hacker assets such as malware, hacking tools, hacking tutorials, and malicious
source code. Cybersecurity analytics organizations employ machine learning models trained on human-labeled data to automatically detect these assets and bolster their situational awareness.
However, the lack of human-labeled training data is prohibitive when analyzing foreign-language dark web content. In this work, we develop a novel Cross-Lingual Hacker Asset Detection method that
automatically leverages the knowledge learned from English content to detect hacker assets in nonEnglish dark web platforms. Our method encompasses a novel Adversarial Deep Representation
Learning (ADREL) method, which generates multilingual text representations using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).


**Multilingual Cyber Threat Detection in Russian and French Darknet Market Places with Adversarial Kernel Matching** ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/rus_fr.png){: style="width: 45%; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}

Learning predictive models in new domains with scarce training data is a growing challenge in modern supervised learning
scenarios. This incentivizes developing domain adaptation methods that leverage the knowledge in known domains (source) and adapt to
new domains (target) with a different probability distribution. This becomes more challenging when the source and target domains are in
heterogeneous feature spaces, known as heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA). While most HDA methods utilize mathematical
optimization to map source and target data to a common space, they suffer from low transferability. Neural representations have proven to
be more transferable; however, they are mainly designed for homogeneous environments. Drawing on the theory of domain adaptation, we
propose a novel framework, Heterogeneous Adversarial Neural Domain Adaptation (HANDA), to effectively maximize the transferability in
heterogeneous environments. HANDA conducts feature and distribution alignment in a unified neural network architecture and achieves
domain invariance through adversarial kernel learning. Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance against the
state-of-the-art HDA methods on major image and text e-commerce benchmarks. HANDA shows statistically significant improvement in
predictive performance. The practical utility of HANDA was shown in real-world dark web online markets. HANDA is an important step
towards successful domain adaptation in e-commerce applications.

**Scanning tunneling noise spectroscopy (STNS).** We have developed a novel cryogenic MHz amplifier that allows us to measure not only the average tunneling current, but also its fluctuation! This has many applications: one can detect the fluctuations of the electronic states, peculiar tunneling processes, and shot noise. We have used this instrument to discover charge trapping in the insulating layer of the cuprates, connected to the c-axis mystery, and to measure the doubling of the charge due to Andreev processes to the superfluid in a lead sample.


**Mott physics and high-temperature superconductivity.** Questions of interest include: (i), How does the Mott state collapse upon doping and how is this related to the complex phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors? (ii), What is the strange metal phase seen in correlated electron systems? Is this an exotic long-range entangled state? What is the mechanism of dissipation in that state? (iii), Why is the transition temperature in high-temperature superconductors so high? We have worked on iridates, rhodates, and cuprates.

**Nanofabricated "Smart Tips"**.
![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/SmartTip.png){: style="width: 250px; float: left; margin: 0px  10px"}
One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB.

**Josephson STM.** Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.
We have used atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. The results and their implications are published in Nature.

We also detected and investigated a quite particular YSR state in the same material.

**Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/STMHead.png){: style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.


**Strange Metals.** The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. Here, the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature T in large areas of the phase diagram, with a mean free path that diminishes to a fraction of the interatomic distance. T-linear resistivity is often associated with quantum critical points and marginal-Fermi-liquid physics. In strange metals, the mystery seems to go even further: we deal with something that looks like a quantum critical phase over an extended range of the phase diagram instead of cumulating in a point. There exists no consistent theory for strange metals, leading to more adventurous new approaches including the holographic theories that use insights from gravity to explain strange metals (a recent textbook on this was written by our colleagues at Leiden University, Schalm and Zaanen).
We are part of the 'Strange Metal consortium NL' that includes the groups of Hussey, Golden, van Heumen, Zaanen, Schalm, Stoof and Vandoren. 

**Magnetic fluctuations and electron spin resonance.**

**Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.**
We have proposed that artificial super-periodicities can lead to improved superconductivity, both because of increased density of states and because of phase space arguments (see image from our SciPost publication below). Perhaps for different reasons, twisted bilayer graphene has been shown to superconduct! We are investigate this material with the groups of Efetov, Baumberger, and van der Molen.
