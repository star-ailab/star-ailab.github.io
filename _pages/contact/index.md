## Open Positions
**Postdoctoral Fellow -- Integrative Genomic Analysis of Lymphoid Cancers**

The Morin and Scott laboratories are seeking a Postdoctoral Fellow to take a leadership role in an ongoing effort to resolve the molecular aetiology of aggressive lymphoid cancers using genomic techniques. This individual will work closely with a team of bioinformaticians, biostatisticians and clinician-scientists in a highly productive and stimulating research environment at a world-class research facility in Vancouver, Canada.

The successful applicant will apply cutting-edge bioinformatic techniques to analyze hundreds of terabytes of high-throughput sequencing data produced from clinical cancer samples, namely RNA-seq (bulk/single cell), whole exome, whole genome, and circulating tumour DNA sequencing data. This position demands a strong background in bioinformatics, computational biology or data science. Detailed knowledge of cancer biology (particularly non-Hodgkin lymphomas) would be an asset.

Familiarity with algorithms for inferring clonal structure of tumours and network/pathway deregulation from sequence data is also desirable. Experience with machine learning, statistical modelling, survival analysis, and data visualization are all desirable. Characteristics of the ideal candidate include strong verbal and written communication skills, attention to detail, creativity, and the ability to remain organized in a fast-paced and dynamic environment. The successful candidate will thrive in our highly collaborative setting while also being able to drive projects independently.

The successful candidate will report to Drs. ​[Ryan Morin​](https://morinlab.github.io/team/) and [David Scott](https://www.bccrc.ca/dept/lcr/people/david-scott) and will be affiliated with [Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre](https://www.bcgsc.ca/) at BC Cancer.

*Duties will include some combination of the following:*

- Deploy pipelines to detect somatic alterations such as CNAs, SNVs, indels and structural alterations/fusion transcripts

- Perform clustering analyses on mutational and/or gene expression features to identify novel subgroupings

- Develop machine learning models for the accurate identification of somatic mutations in heterogeneous and/or noisy tumour samples (*e.g.* FFPE, unpaired, ctDNA)

- Identify *cis*-regulatory mutations using copy number, SV, and non-coding mutations

- Quantify mutational signatures *de novo* or using reference signatures for simple somatic mutations and SVs

- Model the effect of coding and non-coding mutations, respectively, on protein and RNA structure and function

- Resolve clonal substructure and track tumour evolution using tissue biopsies and ctDNA

- Identify gene expression or splicing features associated with clinical or genetic variables

- Create bespoke visualizations of high-dimensional genomic datasets

- Design and execute experiments and disseminate results through conference presentations and publications

- Contribute to the writing of grant applications and training of junior lab members

Suitable candidates should possess a PhD degree in bioinformatics, computer science, or molecular biology and must be competent in at least one programming language such as Python or R.

Diversity is an integral part of Canadian history, culture, and identity. In the Morin laboratory, we strive to maintain an equitable and inclusive culture where all forms of diversity are seen as added value in the unifying goal of reducing the impact of cancer.
