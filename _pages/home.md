#### At Star-AI (&#9733;AI) Lab, we focus on cutting-edge research to make the online space safer.

#### To this end, we develop novel methods in three key areas: AI-enabled cybersecurity, Security of AI, and Privacy of AI. Please see our **[current projects](https://star-ailab.github.io/research/)** and **[publications](https://star-ailab.github.io/publications/)** in each area from our **[team](https://star-ailab.github.io/team/)** 😊 .
