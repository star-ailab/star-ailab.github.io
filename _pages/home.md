  <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; ebrahimim@usf.edu</i>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am an assistant professor and the director of Star-AI Lab at School of Information Systems and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Management (SISM) at the University of South Florida. I received my PhD in Information Systems from <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the University of Arizona, where I was a research assistant at the Artifiical Intelligence (AI) Lab conducted <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; by Regentsâ€™ Professor Hsinchun Chen. In 2016, I received my Master's in Computer Science from <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Concordia University in Montreal, Canada. My Ph.D. Thesis targets two interconnected research areas: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Security of AI and AI for Security. My Master's thesis leveraged crime data mining to enhance juveniles' <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; safety in cyberspace.</p>
